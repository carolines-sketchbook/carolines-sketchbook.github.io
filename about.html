            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Graphic Design major at <a href="https://www.uic.edu/">University of Illinois at Chicago.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the first website that I have done coding for, but not the last! 
                I aspire to be a freelance artist in the distant future, while presently creating works of graphic design for a variety of companies. 
                I enjoy all types of visual art, and hope to expand my experiences in multiple fields where visual art, as well as art in general, is present. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
